---

Welcome to the main site of the course *Statistics and Quantitative
Methods* (Semester 2).

This will be your go-to place throughout the semester.

This course is an introduction to study design, statistics and
quantitative data analysis as commonly employed in linguistics, using
the R software.

## Course description

The course will cover the basics of **statistics and quantitative data
analysis**, and how to **design studies** that effectively address the
intended research questions. Students will learn the principles of
**data visualisation and statistical modelling** and develop the
practical skills necessary to perform such analyses. The course will
draw examples from different branches of linguistics and will provide
students with hands-on experience in open science practices.

The course will teach students how to carry out Bayesian statistical inference using a variety of statistical models, and how to interpret results from traditional Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (i.e. *p*-values and confidence intervals).

## Install R and RStudio

The workshops require you to have R and RStudio installed on your
laptop.
