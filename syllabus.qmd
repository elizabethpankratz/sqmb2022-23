## Overview

This course is an introduction to **quantitative data analysis**, as commonly employed in linguistics, using the R software.

We will cover the following **topics**:

-   The basics of quantitative data analysis.
-   Data preparation.
-   Data summaries.
-   Principles of **data visualisation**.
-   Statistical modelling with **linear models**.
-   Statistical inference using **Bayesian inference**.

At completion of the course you will have gained the following **skills**:

-   Import common data formats, tidy and transform data.
-   Choosing and reporting appropriate summary measures.
-   Using compelling visualisations to communicate a specific message about patterns in the data.
-   Master linear models for different types of data (continuous measures and binary outcomes).
-   Using Bayesian inference to answer research questions and avoid common interpretation pitfalls.

Examples from different branches of linguistics will be used to provide you with hands-on experience in quantitative data analysis and Open Research practices.

#### Homework

**Intake form**

- **You must complete the intake form before coming to the Tuesday lecture.**
- The link to the form will be circulated via Learn.

**Install R and RStudio**

- If you with to use your own laptop for the workshops, instead of the Lab PCs, you need to install both R and RStudio.
- **NOTE**: If you have installed either R or RStudio prior to January 2023, please make sure you delete both R and RStudio from your laptop.
- Please, follow the instructions for **Step 1 and 2** here: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>.
