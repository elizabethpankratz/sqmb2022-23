## Sample $y$

---

.center[
![](../../img/inference.png)
]

When we ask a research question, we collect a sample $y$ from a population.

---

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
$y$ is a sample of values (`\(y_1, y_2, y_3, ..., y_n\)`).
]

--

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
Sample of values can be e.g.:

- Number of telic and atelic verbs in a historical corpus of Sanskrit.

- Voice Onset Time of stops from 50 speakers Mapudungun.

- Friendliness ratings of synthetic speech as indicated by 300 participants.

- ...

**We say that the values in the sample $y$ were generated by a (random) variable $Y$.**

## Variable $Y$

---

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
$Y$ is a (random) variable that generates the values in the sample $y$.
]

--

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
**A (statistical) variable is any characteristics, number, or quantity that can be measured or counted**

- When you observe or measure something, you are taking note of the values generated by the variable.

- It's called variable because it varies (ha!).

- The opposite of a variable is a *constant*.

Variables can be e.g.:

- Token number of telic verbs and atelic verbs in written Sanskrit.

- Voice Onset Time of stops in Mapudungun.

- Friendliness ratings of synthetic speech.

# Operationalisation

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
We can **operationalise** something as a numeric or a categorical variable.
]

--

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
Think of ways to operationalise the following:

- Voice Onset Time.

- Friendliness of speech.

- Lexical frequency.

# Summary measures

---

.center[
![](../../img/data-summ.png)
]

---

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
We can summarise variables using **summary measures**.
]

--

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[

There are two types of summary measures.

**Measures of central tendency**

- Measures of central tendency indicate the **typical or central value** of a sample. 

**Measures of dispersion**

- Measures of dispersion indicate the **spread or dispersion** of the sample values around the central tendency value.
]

--

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
**Always report a measure of central tendency together with a measure of dispersion!**
