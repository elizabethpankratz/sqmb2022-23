When we ask a research question, we collect a sample y from population. y is a variable.

What is a variable?

What is a statistical variable?

When you observe or measure something, you are taking note of the value of a variable.

It's called variable because varies (ha!).

The opposite of a variable is a constant.

There are different types of variables. The first distinction we talk about is numeric vs categorical.

Numeric can be continuous or discrete. Categorical can only be discrete.

Operationalisation. We can operationalise something as numeric or categorical.

Examples of operationalisation.
