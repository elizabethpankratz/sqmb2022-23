Students will learn the principles of data visualisation and statistical modelling and develop the practical skills necessary to perform such analyses. The course will draw examples from different branches of linguistics and will provide students with hands-on experience in open science practices.\nThe course will teach students how to carry out Bayesian statistical inference using a variety of statistical models, and how to interpret results from traditional Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (i.e.Â p-values and confidence intervals)."
