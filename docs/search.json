Think of this as the interface to R.\nThe Environment tab lists the objects created with R, while in the Files tab you can navigate folders on your computer to get to files and open them in the file Editor.\n\nRStudio projects\nRStudio is an IDE (see above) which allows you to work efficiently with R, all in one place.\nNote that files and data live in folders on your computer, outside of RStudio: do not think of RStudio as an app where you can save files in.\nAll the files that you see in the Files tab are files on your computer and you can access them from the Finder or File Explorer as you would with any other file.\nIn principle, you can open RStudio and then navigate to any folder or file on your computer.\nHowever, there is a more efficient way of working with RStudio: RStudio Projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio Projects\n\n\n\nAn RStudio Project is a folder on your computer that has an .Rproj file.\n\n\nYou can create as many RStudio Projects as you wish, and I recommend to create one per project (your dissertation, a research project, etc…).\nWe will create an RStudio Project for this course. You will be using this Project throughout the semester.\nTo create an RStudio Project, click on the button that looks like a transparent light blue box with a plus, in the top-left corner of RStudio. A window like the one below will pop up.\n\nClick on New Directory then New Project.\n\nNow, this will create a new folder (aka directory) on your computer and will make that an RStudio Project.\nGive a name to your new project, something like the name of the course and year.\nThen you need to specify where to create this new folder/Project. Click on Browse… and navigate to the folder you want to create the new folder/Project in.\nWhen done, click on Create Project. RStudio will automatically open your new project.\n\nYou know you are in an RStudio Project because you can see the name of the Project in the top-right corner of RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen working through these tutorials, always make sure you are in the course RStudio Project you just created.\n\n\nIf your see Project (none) in the top-right corner, that means your are not in an RStudio Project.\nThere are several ways of opening an RStudio Project:\n\nYou can go to the RStudio Project folder in Finder or File Explorer and double click on the Rproj file.\nYou can click on File > Open Project in the RStudio menu.\nYou can click on the project name in the top-right corner of RStudio, which will bring up a list of projects. Click on the desired project to open it.\n\n\n\nA few important settings\nBefore moving on, there are a few important settings that you need to change.\n\n\nOpen the RStudio preferences (macOS: RStudio > Preferences..., Windows: Tools > Global options...).\nUn-tick Restore .RData into workspace at startup.\nSelect Never in Save workspace to .RData on exit."

You should see that the answer to the addition has been printed in the Console, like this:\n[1] 3\nNow, try some more operations (write each of the following in the Console and press ENTER). Feel free to add your own to the mix!\n\n67 - 13\n2 * 4\n268 / 43\n\nYou can also chain multiple operations.\n\n6 + 4 - 1 + 2\n4 * 2 + 3 * 2\n\n\n\nVariables\n\nForget-me-not.\n\nMost times, we want to store a certain value so that we can use it again later.\nWe can achieve this by creating variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n\n\n\nA variable holds one or more values and it’s stored in the computer memory for later use.\n\n\nYou can create a variable by using the assignment operator <-.\nLet’s assign the value 156 to the variable my_num.\n\nmy_num <- 156\n\nNow, check the list of variables in the Environment tab of the top-right panel of RStudio. You should see the my_num variable and its value there.\nNow, you can just call the variable back when you need it! Write the following in the Console and press ENTER.\n\nmy_num\n\n[1] 156\n\n\nA variable like my_num is also called a numeric vector: i.e. a vector that contains a number (hence numeric).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVector\n\n\n\nA vector is an R object that contains one or more values of the same type.\n\n\nLet’s now try some operations using variables.\n\nincome <- 1200\nexpenses <- 500\nincome - expenses\n\n[1] 700\n\n\nSee? You can use operations with variables too!\nAnd you can also go all the way with variables.\n\nsavings <- income - expenses\n\nAnd check the value…\n\nsavings\n\n[1] 700\n\n\nVectors can hold more than one item or value.\nJust use the combine c() function to create a vector containing multiple values.\nThe following are all numeric vectors.\n\none_i <- 6\n# Vector with 2 values\ntwo_i <- c(6, 8)\n# Vector with 3 values\nthree_i <- c(6, 8, 42)\n\nCheck the list of variables in the Environment tab. You will see now that before the values of two_i and three_i you get the vector type num for numeric. (If the vector has only one value, you don’t see the type in the Enviroment list but it is still of a particular type).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumeric vector\n\n\n\nA numeric vector is a vector that holds one or more numeric values.\n\n\nNote that the following are the same:\n\none_i <- 6\none_i\n\n[1] 6\n\none_ii <- c(6)\none_ii\n\n[1] 6\n\n\n\n\nFunctions\n\nR cannot function without… functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\n\n\n\nA function is an operation performed on one or more arguments.\n\n\nA function in R has the form function() where:\n\nfunction is the name of the function, like sum.\n() are round parentheses, inside of which you write arguments, separated by commas.\n\nLet’s see an example:\n\nsum(3, 5)\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nThe sum() function sums the number listed as arguments. Above, the arguments are 3 and 5.\nAnd of course arguments can be vectors!\n\nmy_nums <- c(3, 5, 7)\n\nsum(my_nums)\n\n[1] 15\n\nmean(my_nums)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\n\n\nString and logical vectors\n\nNot just numbers.\n\nWe have seen that variables can hold numeric vectors. But vectors are not restricted to being numeric. They can also store strings.\nA string is basically a set of characters (a word, a sentence, a full text).\nIn R, strings have to be quoted using double quotes \" \".\nChange the following strings to your name and surname. Remember to keep the double quotes\n\nname <- \"Stefano\"\nsurname <- \"Coretta\"\n\nname\n\n[1] \"Stefano\"\n\n\nStrings can be used as arguments in functions, like numbers can.\n\ncat(\"My name is\", name, surname)\n\nMy name is Stefano Coretta\n\n\nRemember that you can reuse the same variable name to override the variable value.\n\nname <- \"Raj\"\n\ncat(\"My name is\", name, surname)\n\nMy name is Raj Coretta\n\n\nYou can combine multiple strings into a character vector, using c().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacter vector\n\n\n\nA character vector is a vector that holds one or more strings.\n\n\n\nfruit <- c(\"apple\", \"oranges\", \"bananas\")\nfruit\n\n[1] \"apple\"   \"oranges\" \"bananas\"\n\n\nCheck the Environment tab. Character vectors have chr before the values.\nAnother type of vector is one that contains either TRUE or FALSE. Vectors of this type are called logical vectors and they are listed as logi in the Environment tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogical vector\n\n\n\nA logical vector is a vector that holds one or more TRUE or FALSE values.\n\n\n\ngroceries <- c(\"apple\", \"flour\", \"margarine\", \"sugar\")\nin_pantry <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)\n\nTRUE and FALSE values must be written in all capitals and without double quotes (they are not strings!)."
