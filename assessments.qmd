## Overview

This course will be assessed on the basis of a **3 formative assessments** and **2 summative assessments**.

**Formative assessments** are assessments for which you might receive feedback on, but which will not be marked. These will give you a chance to keep on track with the course contents and get interim feedback that will better prepare you for the summative assessment. See below for info.

You will have to submit **two summative assessments**. They will weight 40% and 60% of the final mark.

See below for details.
